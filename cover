I am a patient person and analyse the requirements or any other matter with a pleasant and calm mind. This is required for any team member or team lead to drive the company's work. I am not a kind of person where I learn something and leave learning new things in the middle of my life. I continuously learn and this will be great benefit to your company. 

This is my dream job to work for a MNC by which I can excel in my career working on new technologies in a foreign country. I will be a good asset to the company who works with passion and is good on over-all activities.
